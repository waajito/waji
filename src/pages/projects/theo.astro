    <p>
      Before Theo, I was at Plex Labs,the core contributor team behind Canto,
      the Layer-1 blockchain focused on Free Public Infrastructure. Building
      open-source DeFi infrastructure taught me what's possible when you
      prioritize accessibility over extraction. So when the team starting Theo
      reached out about their new project, I knew I wanted in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, we've deployed over $284 million in capital, raised $20M from
      investors like Hack VC and Anthos Capital, and launched products that
      compete with the biggest names in DeFi. This is the story of what it's
      been like building the frontend for all of it.
    </p>

    <h2>From Canto to Theo</h2>
    <p>
      Before Theo, I was at Plex Labs,the core engineering team behind Canto, a
      Layer-1 blockchain built around the idea of Free Public Infrastructure.
      Canto's thesis was simple: DeFi's core primitives (DEXs, lending markets,
      stablecoins) should be public goods, not rent-seeking platforms. We built
      the frontend that made that vision usable,the interfaces for swapping,
      lending, bridging, and everything else users needed to interact with the
      network.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canto hit $100M+ TVL within its first month. It was grassroots, no VC
      funding, no token presale,just a team that believed in building accessible
      financial infrastructure. That experience shaped how I think about DeFi:
      complex systems, simple interfaces, ship fast, iterate constantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Theo came calling, the pitch made sense. Same space, different
      angle,taking institutional-grade financial products and making them
      accessible to everyone. My Plex background meant I already knew how to
      build interfaces for complex DeFi mechanics. Theo needed that, and I was
      ready for the next challenge.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Ship: Fast, Clean, Collaborative</h2>
    <p>
      If there's one thing that defines my time at Theo, it's the pace. When
      something needs to get done, it gets done,not in sprints, not in weeks.
      Days. Sometimes hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      That sounds chaotic, but it only works because we've built the right
      processes around it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Speed Without Sacrificing Quality</strong></p>
    <p>
      Early-stage startups often treat speed and quality as a tradeoff. We
      rejected that. Yes, I've shipped features the same day they were
      requested. But we also have QA processes that catch issues before they hit
      production. The secret is keeping the feedback loop tight,small PRs, fast
      reviews, quick iterations.
    </p>
    <p>
      When thBILL was launching, there were moments where requirements changed
      by the hour. New compliance considerations, updated copy, last-minute UX
      tweaks. Being able to turn those around in hours instead of days meant we
      could actually ship on time without cutting corners.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Designer Collaboration (and When to Make Your Own Calls)</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I work closely with our designers, but collaboration doesn't mean waiting
      for a Figma file for every change. Sometimes the best design decisions
      happen in code,when you're implementing something and realize a different
      interaction pattern would work better, or the spacing needs adjustment to
      feel right on actual devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned when to stick to the spec and when to make my own calls.
      Small refinements that improve usability? I'll make them and show the
      designer after. Major UX changes? That's a conversation first. Building
      that trust takes time, but it speeds everything up once you have it.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Backend Handoffs That Actually Work</strong></p>
    <p>
      Nothing kills velocity like waiting on blocked dependencies or discovering
      API mismatches late in development. I've built a solid working
      relationship with our backend team where handoffs are smooth,clear
      contracts, early communication about what's coming, and enough flexibility
      on both sides to adjust when things change.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll often work in parallel: I'll build against a mocked API while
      backend is still implementing, then connect the real endpoints once
      they're ready. It means we're not blocked on each other, and integration
      issues surface early when they're cheap to fix.
    </p>

    <h2>My Work</h2>
    <p>Let me break down the actual projects:</p>

    <p><strong>Landing Pages (V1 → V2 → V3)</strong></p>
    <p>
      The landing page went through three complete iterations. V1 was about
      establishing presence,getting something live that communicated what Theo
      was building. V2 refined the messaging and visual identity as the product
      took shape. V3 is the current version, built to support thBILL, thGOLD,
      and whatever comes next.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each version wasn't just a reskin. The architecture evolved,better
      performance, cleaner animations, more flexible content management. By V3,
      I had a system that could adapt quickly as marketing needs changed.
    </p>

    <p><strong>theo-app V1 & V2 (Main Product Interface)</strong></p>
    <p>
      This is the core product,where users actually deposit assets, track
      positions, and interact with Theo's offerings. V1 was the initial build:
      getting the fundamentals right, connecting to multiple chains, handling
      wallet flows, displaying real-time data.
    </p>
    <p>
      V2 was a significant rebuild. Multi-chain support across Ethereum,
      Arbitrum, Base, Solana, and HyperEVM. Better state management. More
      resilient error handling. Clearer loading states. When thBILL launched and
      became the third-fastest tokenized Treasury to hit $100M, this was the
      interface users were interacting with.
    </p>

    <p><strong>theo-gold-app (thGOLD)</strong></p>
    <p>
      This is the current build,a standalone app for Theo's tokenized gold
      product. Different product, different user expectations, different design
      language. I'm leading this from the ground up: architecture decisions,
      component library, the works.
    </p>
    <p>
      thGOLD has been the most design-intensive project. More input on UX
      decisions, more back-and-forth with designers, more opportunities to make
      calls directly in code. It's essentially building a new product, not
      iterating on an existing one.
    </p>

    <h2>What's Next</h2>
    <p>
      thGOLD is launching soon, and I'm genuinely excited to see it in users'
      hands. After that, who knows? The roadmap keeps expanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I do know is that I'll keep building. Theo went from an idea to $284M
      deployed in under two years. We've partnered with Standard Chartered and
      Wellington Management. We've proven that crypto can do institutional-grade
      finance.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I got to build the interfaces for all of it,fast, clean, and
      collaboratively.
