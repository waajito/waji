    <h2>THE ILLUSION</h2>
    <p>
      When I first got into game development, I didn’t have a plan. I had a
      belief — a slightly delusional one — that software developers were
      modern-day magicians. You thought of something, and with enough effort, it
      existed on a screen. Around 2014, that belief pushed me to stop consuming
      games and start trying to build one.
    </p>

    <h2>BREAKING THE SPELL</h2>
    <p>
      What I didn’t understand at the time was that games are systems, not
      screens. The first thing that broke that illusion for me was physics. A
      jump wasn’t just a jump — it was velocity, gravity, frame timing, and
      collision resolution all fighting each other. I didn’t even have the
      language for these problems yet. I just knew that something always felt
      off.
    </p>

    <h2>THE FIRST SHIP</h2>
    <p>
      After months of half-finished prototypes, I finally shipped my first game, <strong
        >Pocket Hopper</strong
      >. From the outside, it looked simple. Underneath, it was held together by
      brittle logic and hard-coded values. Seeing it live on the Play Store felt
      unreal. And almost immediately, uncomfortable. The controls weren’t tight.
      The feedback wasn’t clear. The game worked, but it didn’t flow.
    </p>

      <div class="marquee-content">

      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>THE SHIFT TO SYSTEMS</h2>
    <p>
      That dissatisfaction pushed me forward. With every new project, I became
      more intentional. I started thinking in terms of systems instead of
      features — separating game state from presentation, letting animations
      respond to logic instead of driving it. I learned that “polish” wasn’t
      visual flair; it was consistency. Predictable physics. Clear hit
      detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      My next published game, <strong>Exile</strong>, reflected that shift. The
      codebase was cleaner. The mechanics were more deliberate. It still wasn’t
      perfect, but it was stable — and stability is underrated when you’re
      building alone.
    </p>

    <h2>THE HIDDEN LESSONS</h2>
    <p>
      Behind those releases sat a long list of unfinished projects. Some
      collapsed under scope. Others exposed limitations in my understanding.
      Without realizing it, game development was shaping how I thought as an
      engineer. Games punish inefficiency immediately. You can’t ignore
      performance when every frame counts. You can’t hand-wave UX when a delay
      of 100 milliseconds makes something feel broken.
    </p>

    <h2>THE TAKEOUT</h2>
    <p>
      Eventually, I stepped away from making games full-time to apply those
      instincts elsewhere. But the habits stuck. Even now, when I build
      software, I think in terms of responsiveness, state, and flow. Pocket
      Hopper wasn’t a hit. Exile didn’t go viral. None of my games made
      headlines. But they taught me how real-time systems behave, how small
      technical decisions affect user experience, and how to build things that
      feel right — not just things that compile.
    </p>
    <p class="accent">
      And once you’ve learned that through games, every other kind of software
      feels a little more honest.
