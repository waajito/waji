    <h2>The Pre-Plex Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Before Plex, I was a solo game developer crafting mobile games as a hobby.
      Unity was my playground, and I was determined to create the next big
      gaming sensation. Game development taught me more than just coding,it
      forced me to master Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, Maya, and Blender. When
      you're a solo dev, you wear every hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This multi-disciplinary background became my secret weapon in DeFi. By the
      time Plex found me, I had an unusual combination of technical skills,
      design sensibility, and product thinking.
    </p>

    <h2>May 2022: The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      I joined Plex Labs as a frontend engineer to work on Canto,a Layer-1
      blockchain with a radical thesis: DeFi's core primitives should be public
      goods, not rent-seeking platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most blockchains let projects extract fees at every layer. Canto rejected
      that. The network provided Free Public Infrastructure,a native DEX, a
      lending market (CLM), and a decentralized stablecoin (NOTE),all without
      governance tokens skimming value from users. The idea was that if these
      primitives exist as public utilities, developers can build on top without
      competing against the base layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canto was built using the Cosmos SDK with Tendermint consensus, but ran a
      full EVM,meaning Ethereum developers could deploy their contracts without
      rewriting anything. It was grassroots from day one: no VC funding, no
      token presale, no vested insiders. Just a team of builders with
      backgrounds in high-frequency trading and mechanism design who believed
      DeFi could work differently.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan for me was simple: implement designs. But startups expand your
      role. Within weeks, I wasn't just implementing designs; I was making
      design decisions, optimizing user experiences, and bridging the gap
      between technical implementation and user-facing polish.
    </p>

        ]}
      />
    </div>

    <h3>Phase 1: The Learning Curve (V1 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Build a suite of DeFi applications with a cohesive
      visual identity.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Beautiful code doesn't automatically mean beautiful
      user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      V1 was where I cut my teeth on blockchain. The terminal aesthetic emerged
      from my Cyberpunk inspirations. Those neon scanlines weren't just
      flair,they were an attempt to make blockchain feel futuristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, our modular architecture (9 separate subdomains) was a UX
      nightmare. Users had to reconnect wallets constantly. For a chain trying
      to onboard users into DeFi, friction like that was unacceptable.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 2: The Consolidation Master (V2 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Fix V1's UX flaws without compromising the vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Sometimes you have to tear everything down to
      build something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rebuilt the platform to solve the wallet connection problem,a
      product-killing flaw. This phase pushed me beyond frontend; I optimized
      state management, designed cross-chain flows with Cosmos IBC bridging, and
      focused on mobile-first design.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was when Canto started gaining real traction. The TVL climbed past
      $100 million within the first month of mainnet. By early 2023, it had
      doubled again, and Canto became one of the top Layer-1s in the Cosmos
      ecosystem. Watching users interact with interfaces I built,swapping on the
      DEX, supplying to the lending market, bridging from Ethereum,validated the
      long hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Peak Performance:</strong> 157 commits in 90 days.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 3: The Lost Masterpiece (Carthage Era)</h3>
    <p>
      Calculated component architecture and mature design systems. Although
      cancelled, Carthage taught me that the value isn't just in shipping, but
      in becoming the kind of developer who can build something great.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 4: The Masterpiece (V3 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Create the definitive statement of what DeFi
      interfaces could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Creative expression and technical excellence
      aren't mutually exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We adopted a Windows 95 aesthetic. It wasn't just nostalgia,it was a
      philosophy to make complex financial interactions feel approachable and
      delightful. While other DeFi interfaces went for cold, sterile
      "professional" looks, we leaned into personality. Canto's ethos was about
      accessibility, and the UI needed to reflect that.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this point, Canto had established itself as a legitimate player. The
      ecosystem had grown to include NFT projects, on-chain games, additional
      DeFi protocols building on top of our Free Public Infrastructure. The
      monthly hackathons brought in dozens of new projects. We weren't just
      maintaining a blockchain frontend anymore,we were supporting an ecosystem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Technical Evolution:</strong> From basic React to Next.js with TypeScript
      and comprehensive testing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1,100+ commits across the journey.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>The Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      By August 2024, my journey with Plex was complete,over two years of
      building, iterating, and shipping.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had proven that a developer with design sensibilities could build
      world-class user experiences in blockchain. We proved that DeFi interfaces
      didn't have to be ugly, intimidating, or sterile. They could be beautiful,
      approachable, and delightful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Canto showed that a different model was possible,public infrastructure
      over private extraction, community over VCs, usability over complexity.
      And I got to build the interfaces that brought that vision to life.
    </p>
