      A 2.5-year evolution from game developer to building some of the most
      innovative DeFi interfaces in the blockchain space. A story of evolution,
      persistence, beautiful failures, and technical achievement.
    </p>

    <h2>The Pre-Plex Foundation</h2>
    <p>
      Before Plex, I was a solo game developer crafting mobile games as a hobby.
      Unity was my playground, and I was determined to create the next big
      gaming sensation. Game development taught me more than just coding-it
      forced me to master Photoshop, Illustrator, Figma, Maya, and Blender. When
      you're a solo dev, you wear every hat. This multi-disciplinary background
      became my secret weapon in DeFi. By the time Plex found me, I had an
      unusual combination of technical skills, design sensibility, and product
      thinking.
    </p>

    <h2>May 2022: The Beginning</h2>
    <p>
      I joined Plex as a frontend engineer to work on Canto-a Layer 1
      blockchain. The plan was simple: implement designs. But startups expand
      your role. Within weeks, I wasn't just implementing designs; I was making
      design decisions, optimizing user experiences, and bridging the gap
      between technical implementation and user-facing polish.
    </p>

        ]}
      />
    </div>

    <h3>Phase 1: The Learning Curve (V1 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Build a suite of DeFi applications with a cohesive
      visual identity.<br />
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Beautiful code doesn't automatically mean beautiful
      user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      V1 was where I cut my teeth on blockchain. The terminal aesthetic emerged
      from my Cyberpunk inspirations. Those neon scanlines weren't just
      flair-they were an attempt to make blockchain feel futuristic. However,
      our modular architecture (9 separate subdomains) was a UX nightmare. Users
      had to reconnect wallets constantly.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 2: The Consolidation Master (V2 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Fix V1's UX flaws without compromising the vision.<br
      />
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Sometimes you have to tear everything down to
      build something better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I rebuilt the platform to solve the wallet connection problem-a
      product-killing flaw. This phase pushed me beyond frontend; I optimized
      state management, designed cross-chain flows, and focused on mobile-first
      design.
      <strong>Peak Performance:</strong> 157 commits in 90 days.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 3: The Lost Masterpiece (Carthage Era)</h3>
    <p>
      Calculated component architecture and mature design systems. Although
      cancelled, Carthage taught me that the value isn't just in shipping, but
      in becoming the kind of developer who <em>can</em> build something great.
    </p>

    <h3>Phase 4: The Masterpiece (V3 Era)</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>The Challenge:</strong> Create the definitive statement of what DeFi
      interfaces could be.<br />
      <strong>Key Learning:</strong> Creative expression and technical excellence
      aren't mutually exclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We adopted a <strong>Windows 95 aesthetic</strong>. It wasn't just
      nostalgia-it was a philosophy to make complex financial interactions feel
      approachable and delightful. Technical Evolution: From basic React to
      Next.js with TypeScript and comprehensive testing.
      <strong>1100+ commits</strong> across the journey.
    </p>

    <h2>The Legacy</h2>
    <p>
      By August 2024, my journey with Plex was complete. I had proven that a
      developer with design sensibilities could build world-class user
      experiences in blockchain. We proved that DeFi interfaces didn't have to
      be ugly, intimidating, or sterile. They could be beautiful, approachable,
      and delightful.
