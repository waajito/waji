        <p>
            A few years ago, I worked on a project that still comes back to me
            every now and then—not because it was wildly successful, but because
            of how much it demanded from me, both technically and personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company was called <strong>Arcrome Technologies</strong>. It was
            started by three founders from an architecture background. They had
            spent years designing physical spaces, and now they wanted to build
            a product for the general public—something interactive, visual, and
            immersive. Their idea was a kiosk application, the kind you’d place
            in movie theatres or malls, where people could walk up, touch the
            screen, and have an experience rather than just complete a task.
        </p>

        <h2>THE VISION</h2>
        <p>
            The core idea was simple on paper. A large touch-screen kiosk. A
            “Let’s Start” button. A slick animation that pulls you into a
            movie-selection screen. You swipe left or right, pick a movie,
            choose how to pay—prepaid or cash—and then take pictures with
            celebrities from that movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            But simplicity on paper often hides complexity underneath. Once a
            user selected a movie, the payment flow kicked in. For prepaid
            users, there was a card-swiping unit attached to the kiosk. For cash
            payments, a nearby worker would collect the money and enter a unique
            code into the system. Every worker had their own code, which meant
            the system could track exactly how much cash each person was
            responsible for at the end of the day. It was a small detail, but
            one that mattered a lot in a real-world setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            After payment, the experience shifted gears. A countdown began. An
            animation played. The screen told users exactly where to stand, with
            markings on the ground to guide them. Then came the magic: a
            pre-recorded video of celebrities—shot earlier on a green
            screen—played on the display. At the same time, the kiosk captured
            live images of the user and composited them together in real time.
        </p>

        <h2>THE HARDWARE REALITY</h2>
        <p>
            To make that illusion believable, everything had to line up. The
            lighting used when the celebrity video was recorded had to be
            recreated precisely inside the kiosk. Even small mismatches would
            break the illusion instantly. This wasn’t just software—it was
            physics, optics, and user perception all colliding at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            That entire system landed on my plate. The founders weren’t
            particularly tech-savvy, and they were upfront about it. They relied
            on me not just to build the software, but to define what was
            technically possible in the first place. They showed me an early
            version of the UI and asked a simple question: Is this feasible? I
            asked for wireframes. They gave me rough sketches. I took those and
            redesigned the UI from scratch—keeping their vision intact, but
            grounding it in reality.
        </p>

        <h2>THE BUILD</h2>
        <p>
            This product needed payment integration, live camera feeds,
            real-time chroma keying, server-driven content, and smooth
            animations, all running continuously in public spaces. That
            immediately meant we needed serious hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            After evaluating the constraints, I made a call: <strong
                >Unity</strong
            > would be the foundation. It gave us real-time rendering, animation control,
            shader access, and hardware flexibility—all under one roof.
        </p>
        <p>
            To turn the kiosk into a true touch system, we paired a <strong
                >55-inch TV</strong
            > with a <strong>55-inch IR touch frame</strong> and connected it to a
            PC. We added a DSLR camera for image quality. Every piece of hardware
            had to be selected, tested, and integrated carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>BACKEND & INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
            We built the backend using <strong>Strapi</strong>, a CMS that let
            us model collections like movies, metadata, and assets cleanly. All
            of it was hosted on <strong>AWS</strong>, with videos stored
            separately. One major challenge was video delivery. These were
            high-quality files—gigabytes in size. Streaming them constantly was
            unrealistic. So I designed a caching system: videos would download
            when the kiosk booted up, after every 24 hours, or when a nearby
            worker manually triggered an update. During this time, the kiosk
            would enter maintenance mode and show a progress bar.
        </p>

        <h2>THE MAGIC: REAL-TIME COMPOSITING</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote a <strong>custom shader</strong> to perform chroma keying in real
            time, removing the green background from the celebrity footage cleanly.
            The live camera feed was then layered behind it, creating the illusion
            of presence. It took countless iterations—tweaking thresholds, lighting,
            color spill—but eventually, it worked.

        <h2>TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE</h2>
        <TechSpecs specs={specs} />

        <h2>THE PITCH & THE PIVOT</h2>
        <p>
            The prototype eventually made its way into real conversations with
            investors. People were interested—but interest came with conditions.
            "What else can it do?" Some wanted social sharing. Others wanted
            analytics dashboards. The goalposts kept moving.
        </p>

        <h2>THE LESSON</h2>
        <p>
            Building something real in the physical world requires alignment,
            timing, and restraint as much as engineering. Sometimes the hardest
            part isn’t building the thing—it’s deciding when enough is enough.
            That project taught me more than many “successful” ones ever did. It
            forced me to think end-to-end—hardware, software, users,
            constraints, and reality. That doesn’t make it a failure. It just
            makes it a chapter.
