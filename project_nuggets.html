            A simple news app that took years to finish. <br>
            A journey of mental models and offline-first architecture.

        <p>
            This project didn’t start with a breakthrough moment. It started with hesitation.
            I first attempted this app in 2019, when Flutter was still finding its footing. I experimented, learned just
            enough to realize how much I didn’t know—and then I stopped.
            I repeated that cycle more than once.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the time, I assumed the problem was Flutter. In reality, the problem was my own transition. I was coming
            from a game development background (OOP, explicit lifecycles) and Android (imperative UI).
            Flutter asked for something different: a declarative approach where UI is a function of state. That mental
            shift took years to settle.
        </p>

        <h2>WHEN IT CLICKED</h2>
        <p>
            When I returned to Flutter later, the declarative approach no longer felt foreign. It felt intentional.
            Layout, spacing, gestures—everything followed the same compositional rules.
            That was the moment the original idea resurfaced: build a news app. Not because it was unique, but because
            it was demanding in the right ways.
        </p>

        <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
        <p>
            A news app appears simple on the surface, but it forces difficult technical decisions immediately.
            Network reliability, caching, pagination, notifications, read states—features that separate a "demo" from a
            "product".
            The result was <strong>Nuggets</strong>: a summarized news application designed to be fast, minimal, and
            resilient.
        </p>

        <h2>OFFLINE FIRST</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most important decisions was adopting an <strong>offline-first approach</strong> via
            <strong>ObjectBox</strong>.
            On launch, the app checks connectivity. If offline, cached content displays immediately. The network is
            treated as an enhancement, not a dependency.
            This single decision significantly improved perceived performance.
        </p>

        <h2>PERCEIVED RESPONSIVENESS</h2>
        <p>
            Images are central to news but are performance liabilities.
            I combined aggressive caching with <strong>BlurHash</strong> placeholders. While images load, users see a
            meaningful blurry preview rather than a blank container, reducing visual jank.
            Users can also toggle between high-quality images and data-saving thumbnails.
        </p>

        <h2>THE LESSON</h2>
        <p>
            This app wasn’t built to chase metrics. It was built to close a gap in understanding.
            It reinforced that frameworks are rarely the real obstacle—mental models are. It showed me the value of
            patience, restraint, and choosing problems that force you to confront fundamentals.
            Some projects don’t wait for motivation. They wait for readiness.
