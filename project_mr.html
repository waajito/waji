        <div class="img-block">[KIOSK_HARDWARE_SETUP]</div>

        <p>
            A few years ago, I worked on a project that still comes back to me every now and then—not because it was
            wildly successful, but because of how much it demanded from me, both technically and personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company was called <strong>Arcrome Technologies</strong>. It was started by three founders from an
            architecture background. They had spent years designing physical spaces, and now they wanted to build a
            product for the general public—something interactive, visual, and immersive. Their idea was a kiosk
            application, the kind you’d place in movie theatres or malls, where people could walk up, touch the screen,
            and have an experience rather than just complete a task.
        </p>

        <h2>THE VISION</h2>
        <p>
            The core idea was simple on paper. A large touch-screen kiosk. A “Let’s Start” button. A slick animation
            that pulls you into a movie-selection screen. You swipe left or right, pick a movie, choose how to
            pay—prepaid or cash—and then take pictures with celebrities from that movie.
        </p>
        <p>
            But simplicity on paper often hides complexity underneath. Once a user selected a movie, the payment flow
            kicked in. For prepaid users, there was a card-swiping unit attached to the kiosk. For cash payments, a
            nearby worker would collect the money and enter a unique code into the system. Every worker had their own
            code, which meant the system could track exactly how much cash each person was responsible for at the end of
            the day. It was a small detail, but one that mattered a lot in a real-world setup.
        </p>
        <p>
            After payment, the experience shifted gears. A countdown began. An animation played. The screen told users
            exactly where to stand, with markings on the ground to guide them. Then came the magic: a pre-recorded video
            of celebrities—shot earlier on a green screen—played on the display. At the same time, the kiosk captured
            live images of the user and composited them together in real time.
        </p>

        <h2>THE HARDWARE REALITY</h2>
        <p>
            To make that illusion believable, everything had to line up. The lighting used when the celebrity video was
            recorded had to be recreated precisely inside the kiosk. Even small mismatches would break the illusion
            instantly. This wasn’t just software—it was physics, optics, and user perception all colliding at once.
        </p>
        <p>
            That entire system landed on my plate. The founders weren’t particularly tech-savvy, and they were upfront
            about it. They relied on me not just to build the software, but to define what was technically possible in
            the first place. They showed me an early version of the UI and asked a simple question: Is this feasible? I
            asked for wireframes. They gave me rough sketches. I took those and redesigned the UI from scratch—keeping
            their vision intact, but grounding it in reality.
        </p>

        <h2>THE BUILD</h2>
        <p>
            This product needed payment integration, live camera feeds, real-time chroma keying, server-driven content,
            and smooth animations, all running continuously in public spaces. That immediately meant we needed serious
            hardware.
        </p>
        <p>
            After evaluating the constraints, I made a call: <strong>Unity</strong> would be the foundation. It gave us
            real-time rendering, animation control, shader access, and hardware flexibility—all under one roof.
        </p>
        <p>
            To turn the kiosk into a true touch system, we paired a <strong>55-inch TV</strong> with a <strong>55-inch
                IR touch frame</strong> and connected it to a PC. We added a DSLR camera for image quality. Every piece
            of hardware had to be selected, tested, and integrated carefully.
        </p>

        <h2>BACKEND & INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>
        <p>
            We built the backend using <strong>Strapi</strong>, a CMS that let us model collections like movies,
            metadata, and assets cleanly. All of it was hosted on <strong>AWS</strong>, with videos stored separately.
            One major challenge was video delivery. These were high-quality files—gigabytes in size. Streaming them
            constantly was unrealistic. So I designed a caching system: videos would download when the kiosk booted up,
            after every 24 hours, or when a nearby worker manually triggered an update. During this time, the kiosk
            would enter maintenance mode and show a progress bar.
        </p>

        <h2>THE MAGIC: REAL-TIME COMPOSITING</h2>
        <p>
            I wrote a <strong>custom shader</strong> to perform chroma keying in real time, removing the green
            background from the celebrity footage cleanly. The live camera feed was then layered behind it, creating the
            illusion of presence. It took countless iterations—tweaking thresholds, lighting, color spill—but
            eventually, it worked.
        </p>

        <h2>THE PITCH & THE PIVOT</h2>
        <p>
            The prototype eventually made its way into real conversations with investors. People were interested—but
            interest came with conditions. "What else can it do?"
            Some wanted social sharing. Others wanted analytics dashboards. The goalposts kept moving.
        </p>

        <h2>THE LESSON</h2>
        <p>
            Building something real in the physical world requires alignment, timing, and restraint as much as
            engineering. Sometimes the hardest part isn’t building the thing—it’s deciding when enough is enough.
            That project taught me more than many “successful” ones ever did. It forced me to think end-to-end—hardware,
            software, users, constraints, and reality. That doesn’t make it a failure. It just makes it a chapter.
