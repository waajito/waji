        <h2>THE ILLUSION</h2>
        <p>
            When I first got into game development, I didn’t have a plan. I had a belief — a slightly delusional one —
            that software developers were modern-day magicians. You thought of something, and with enough effort, it
            existed on a screen.
            Around 2014, that belief pushed me to stop consuming games and start trying to build one.
        </p>

        <h2>BREAKING THE SPELL</h2>
        <p>
            What I didn’t understand at the time was that games are systems, not screens. The first thing that broke
            that illusion for me was physics. A jump wasn’t just a jump — it was velocity, gravity, frame timing, and
            collision resolution all fighting each other.
            I didn’t even have the language for these problems yet. I just knew that something always felt off.
        </p>

        <h2>THE FIRST SHIP</h2>
        <p>
            After months of half-finished prototypes, I finally shipped my first game, <strong>Pocket Hopper</strong>.
            From the outside, it looked simple. Underneath, it was held together by brittle logic and hard-coded values.
            Seeing it live on the Play Store felt unreal. And almost immediately, uncomfortable. The controls weren’t
            tight. The feedback wasn’t clear. The game worked, but it didn’t flow.
        </p>

        </div>

        <h2>THE SHIFT TO SYSTEMS</h2>
        <p>
            That dissatisfaction pushed me forward. With every new project, I became more intentional. I started
            thinking in terms of systems instead of features — separating game state from presentation, letting
            animations respond to logic instead of driving it.
            I learned that “polish” wasn’t visual flair; it was consistency. Predictable physics. Clear hit detection.
        </p>
        <p>
            My next published game, <strong>Exile</strong>, reflected that shift. The codebase was cleaner. The
            mechanics were more deliberate. It still wasn’t perfect, but it was stable — and stability is underrated
            when you’re building alone.
        </p>

        <h2>THE HIDDEN LESSONS</h2>
        <p>
            Behind those releases sat a long list of unfinished projects. Some collapsed under scope. Others exposed
            limitations in my understanding.
            Without realizing it, game development was shaping how I thought as an engineer. Games punish inefficiency
            immediately. You can’t ignore performance when every frame counts. You can’t hand-wave UX when a delay of
            100 milliseconds makes something feel broken.
        </p>

        <h2>THE TAKEOUT</h2>
        <p>
            Eventually, I stepped away from making games full-time to apply those instincts elsewhere. But the habits
            stuck. Even now, when I build software, I think in terms of responsiveness, state, and flow.
            Pocket Hopper wasn’t a hit. Exile didn’t go viral. None of my games made headlines.
            But they taught me how real-time systems behave, how small technical decisions affect user experience, and
            how to build things that feel right — not just things that compile.
        </p>
        <p class="accent">
            And once you’ve learned that through games, every other kind of software feels a little more honest.
        </p>
